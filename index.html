      <h1>Anthony Chavez Test Page</h1>
      <p>One topic I'm interested is <strong>cyber security</strong>. In fact, I took CSC 152 and CSC 154 at California State University, Sacramento to gain some introductory cyber security knowledge. Initially, I was on track to get the <a href="https://catalog.csus.edu/colleges/engineering-computer-science/computer-science/certificate-in-information-assurance-and-security/">Certificate in Information Assurance and Security</a>, but CSC 153 got cancelled. I plan to use this knowledge to advance my career in the IT field.</p>
